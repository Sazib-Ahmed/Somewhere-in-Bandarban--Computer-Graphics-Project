# Somewhere-in-Bandarban--Computer-Graphics-Project
As a component of my Computer Graphics course, I created a project called "Somewhere in Bandarban" independently. The purpose of the project was to visually showcase the natural beauty of Bandarban, Bangladesh. I utilized various tools and techniques in computer graphics to achieve my goal. Throughout the project, I encountered several obstacles that I successfully resolved. Overall, the experience was enjoyable, and I gained valuable knowledge in the field of computer graphics.
